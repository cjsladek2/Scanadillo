  "phosphoric acid": {
    "chemical_properties": "Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a colorless, odorless, syrupy liquid that is soluble in water. It has a melting point of 42.35 \u00b0C and a boiling point of 158 \u00b0C. It is classified as a weak acid with a pKa value of approximately 2.15, 7.2, and 12.37 for its three dissociation steps respectively.",
    "common_uses": "Phosphoric acid is commonly used as an acidity regulator in food and beverages, especially in soft drinks. It is also utilized in fertilizers, dental products, and metal treatment processes, as well as in the manufacture of cleaning agents.",
    "safety_and_controversy": "Phosphoric acid is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used in food production. However, its excessive consumption can lead to potential health issues like dental erosion and bone density loss. There are concerns about its role in phosphate pollution, which can cause environmental issues in water bodies.",
    "environmental_and_regulation": "Phosphoric acid is regulated as a hazardous substance under various environmental laws due to its potential to cause eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. Proper disposal and management are required to mitigate environmental impacts related to its use and release.",

  "citric acid": {
    "chemical_properties": "Citric acid is a weak organic acid with the chemical formula C6H8O7. It is a colorless or white crystalline substance and is highly soluble in water. Citric acid has a pK1 of 3.1, making it a triprotic acid that can donate three protons (H+) in solution.",
    "common_uses": "Citric acid is commonly used as a natural preservative, flavoring agent in food and beverages, and as a cleaning agent. It is also used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries as a pH adjuster and in various chemical applications.",
    "safety_and_controversy": "Citric acid is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA when used in food. However, excessive consumption can lead to gastrointestinal discomfort. There are minimal controversies surrounding citric acid, primarily concerning its production process from genetically modified organisms (GMOs).",
    "environmental_and_regulation": "Citric acid is biodegradable and considered environmentally friendly. Regulatory agencies have set safety standards for its use in food and industrial applications, which are generally adhered to in most countries.",

  "natural flavor": {
    "chemical_properties": "Natural flavors are typically derived from plant or animal sources and consist of various chemical compounds, including esters, aldehydes, and alcohols, which contribute to their aroma and taste profiles.",
    "common_uses": "Natural flavors are widely used in food and beverage products, such as candies, baked goods, dairy products, and soft drinks, to enhance taste and aroma.",
    "safety_and_controversy": "Most natural flavors are considered safe for consumption; however, some individuals may have allergic reactions or sensitivities to specific natural flavor components. The term 'natural flavor' can also be controversial due to its vague definition, leading to consumer concerns about transparency.",
    "environmental_and_regulation": "Natural flavors are regulated by the FDA and must comply with safety standards. While extraction processes vary, there are sustainability concerns regarding the sourcing of certain natural flavor ingredients, especially those derived from endangered species or unsustainable agricultural practices.",
